# ðŸ’  Qwind

**Qwind** is a free and open-source template to make your website using **[Qwik](https://qwik.builder.io/) + [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)**. Ready to start a new project and designed taking into account best practices.

</details>

<br>

## Getting started

This project is using Qwik with [QwikCity](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/overview/). QwikCity is just a extra set of tools on top of Qwik to make it easier to build a full site, including directory-based routing, layouts, and more.

### Project structure

- `src/routes`: Provides the directory based routing, which can include a hierarchy of `layout.tsx` layout files, and an `index.tsx` file as the page. Additionally, `index.ts` files are endpoints. Please see the [routing docs](https://qwik.builder.io/qwikcity/routing/overview/) for more info.

- `src/components`: Recommended directory for components.

- `public`: Any static assets, like images, can be placed in the public directory. Please see the [Vite public directory](https://vitejs.dev/guide/assets.html#the-public-directory) for more info.

### Commands

All commands are run from the root of the project, from a terminal:

| Command            | Action                                         |

| `npm install`      | Installs dependencies                          |
| `npm run dev`      | Starts local dev server at `127.0.0.1:5173/`   |
| `npm run build`    | Build your production site to `./dist/`        |
| `npm run preview`  | Preview your build locally, before deploying   |
| `npm run fmt`      | Format codes with Prettier                     |
| `npm run lint`     | Run Eslint                                     |

<br>

### Configuration

Basic configuration file: `./src/config.mjs`

```javascript
export const SITE = {
  name: "Example",

  origin: "https://example.com",
  basePathname: "/", // Change this if you need to deploy to Github Pages, for example
  trailingSlash: true, // Generate permalinks with or without "/" at the end
};
```

<br>

### Deploy

#### Deploy to production (manual)

You can create an optimized production build with:

```shell
npm run build
```

Now, your website is ready to be deployed. All generated files are located at
`dist` folder, which you can deploy the folder to any hosting service you
prefer.
