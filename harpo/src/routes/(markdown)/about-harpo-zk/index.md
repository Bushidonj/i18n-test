## About Harpo-ZK

## ⚖️ Trilemma: Balancing Privacy, Innovation, and Openness

Harpo-ZK was created to solve one of the biggest challenges in institutional blockchain: maintaining the balance between **decentralization**, **programmability**, and **privacy** without compromising any of these pillars.

- **Decentralization** in the provision of products and services, allowing different institutions to operate autonomously and securely.
- **Programmability** to develop and compose modern, customizable, and scalable financial services.
- **Privacy** compatible with legal requirements, protecting users' sensitive data without sacrificing regulatory transparency.

> Harpo-ZK doesn't choose one side of the triangle — it delivers all vertices with efficiency, compliance, and innovation.

## 🔐 Integrated Privacy: How Harpo-ZK Protects Digital Transactions

Harpo-ZK establishes a secure bridge between financial institutions' systems and the blockchain.  
It allows sensitive data to be processed off the public network and validated with full integrity within the blockchain environment.

Through components like **Core**, **Prover**, and **Validator**, Harpo-ZK ensures that confidential information — such as user credentials, contract data, and audits — is protected without compromising the transparency and traceability required by regulations.

> It's the ideal combination of secrecy and trust for those seeking innovation with digital security.

## 🔐 Advanced Encryption: Digital Security in Every Transaction

Harpo-ZK uses cutting-edge encryption techniques to protect every stage of a digital operation.  
Transaction data — such as owner address, token type, value, and unique identifiers — is processed with security layers involving **public and private key encryption**, along with the creation of elements like **nullifier** and **commitment**, which ensure operation integrity and untraceability.

This approach ensures that sensitive information is not exposed on the public network, enabling a reliable, secure blockchain experience that complies with regulatory requirements.

> With Harpo-ZK, privacy is no longer a challenge but a competitive advantage.

## 🔄 Secure Transfer Between Parties: Tokens, Commitments, and Traceability

Harpo-ZK structures a sophisticated transfer model between participants, where each operation is associated with a **digital token** and protected by **cryptographic commitments**.  
Throughout the process, **nullifiers** ensure that transactions are unique, valid, and traceable — even in environments with multiple participants such as financial institutions, clients, and partners.

Elements like the *Commitment Tree* and *Nullifier Map* ensure that every movement occurs with integrity, transparency, and privacy protection.

> At Harpo-ZK, every token tells a secure story — from sender to recipient, with trust at every step.

## 💼 Secure and Verified Settlement: Party Interaction with Cryptographic Guarantee

Harpo technology provides a blockchain environment where transactions between parties are processed with a high level of privacy and security.  
In this flow, elements such as **tokens (T)**, **commitments ( # )**, and **nullifiers ( X )** are used to ensure that each operation has a legitimate origin, is unique, and can be validated with full reliability.

The **DvP – Liquidator** component acts as a transaction verifier, ensuring that assets exchanged between Party A and Party B are settled fairly and synchronously, with no risk of duplication or exposure of confidential data.

> Harpo transforms financial settlement into a secure, traceable process tailored to the requirements of the digital banking sector.

## 🔐 Encrypted Tokens: Protection of Traded Assets and Values

Harpo enables the creation of **representative tokens** of assets and monetary values, encrypted with participants' public keys and combined with a previously agreed-upon single-use number.  
This approach ensures that the asset and its value remain fully protected — even before the transaction is recorded on the blockchain.

Each party (Party A and Party B) enters their own encrypted data into the system, which is processed through the `delegatedTransfer` component. The combined use of **output**, **counterpartAsset**, and **settlementAgent** ensures integrity, traceability, and compliance with privacy rules.

> At Harpo-ZK, security is more than a feature — it's the foundation for reliable, modern transactions.

## 🧠 Anonymity with Transparency: Encrypted Events and Auditable Data on the Blockchain

Harpo-ZK combines the power of **zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP)** with advanced cryptography to provide a blockchain environment where institutions can publish data and events securely and anonymously.

In the Harpo-ZK model:
- Sensitive information is kept **off-chain** by institutions (Party A, B, and C), which operate with prover, encrypter, and auditor functions.
- A dedicated **Harpo-ZK** node receives encrypted data, securely validates the proofs, and emits on-chain events.
- Private inputs (such as participant keys and token contents) are never exposed, while public inputs ensure traceability and compliance — including the **commitment tree root**, **encrypted audit trail**, and **mass conservation proofs**.

> Harpo-ZK is where technological innovation meets institutional responsibility — with privacy for the user and clarity for the market.
