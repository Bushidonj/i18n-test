 In the last post, I talked about how full data exposure on a public blockchain can be harmful — even in regulated systems like Drex.  
But how to solve this without losing verifiability?  
**The answer: Harpo.**  
And here's how it works, in a simple and modular way:

---

##  1. UTXO-based model

Instead of a continuous balance history (like in traditional accounts), Harpo uses the **UTXO (Unspent Transaction Output)** model — the same one adopted by Bitcoin.  
Each transaction consumes and generates discrete "tokens," making it easier to apply **consistency proofs** without needing to expose the original data.

---

##  2. Privacy layer with ZKP

Every private operation is validated with **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKP)**, ensuring that:

- The amount is correct  
- There is sufficient balance  
- The recipient is authorized  

 **Without publicly revealing the data.**  
This is the core of Harpo: **trust without exposure.**

---

##  3. Modular and interoperable

Harpo doesn't require creating a new blockchain or structural changes to Drex.  
It's a **modular privacy solution** for public networks compatible with EVM, like Ethereum.

You can:

- Execute private transactions  
- Prove something was done correctly, without revealing the data  
- Audit what needs to be audited  
- Preserve the public transparency required by regulated environments  

**This enables:**

- Swaps between public private tokens  
- Selective audit by authorities (no backdoors)  
- Integration with existing smart contracts

---

##  4. Authority in the loop, without unrestricted access

The authority can audit a specific transaction, with consent or regulatory order, through proofs that confirm:

- Origin and destination  
- Operation validity  
-  Without revealing the full content  

In other words:  
**Not everything is public. But nothing is out of control.**

## 

- Confidentiality for users and companies  
- Verifiability for regulators  
- Integration with Drex, without compromising the trust model
