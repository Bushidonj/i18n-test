title: Privacy matters. Even when everything seems public.
excerpt: John borrowed money from Mary. He needed to pay an urgent debt. Days later, he still hadn't paid it back. He asked for more time.

## 🔎 Imagine the following scene:

John borrowed money from Mary. He needed to pay an urgent debt.  
Days later, he still hadn't paid it back. He asked for more time.  
😒 But... Mary saw on Instagram that John was at a barbecue with friends, drinking beer, and posting stories.  

Now imagine if, instead of stories, what Mary saw was John's bank transaction history — public, immutable, on a network like **Drex**.  

💥 The issue here isn't whether John is right or wrong.  
It's that total exposure can lead to **judgment, conflicts, and irreversible consequences**.

## 🏦 Now change the names:

- "John" to **individual**, **small business owner**, or **strategic company**.  
- "Mary" to **competitor**, **rival financial institution**, or **potential creditor**.

### If everything is public:

- Banks can "sniff out" good clients and offer lower rates  
- Companies can cross-reference competitors' financial data  
- Personal purchases become targets for judgment or discrimination  

❗ This isn't fiction.  
This is what happens when we implement **CBDCs** or **tokenized assets** on public networks without any privacy layer.

## 🔐 The challenge

Networks like Drex were designed to be **transparent and auditable**.  
Adding **privacy** without losing **consistency or trust** is an extremely difficult task.  

🔍 Large companies, with huge teams and resources, haven't been able to deliver this in a viable way.

## 🎯 That's why we created Harpo

✅ A solution based on **Zero-Knowledge Proofs (ZKPs)** that enables:

- Transaction privacy  
- Selective audit by authorities  
- Consistency with the Drex model (no sidechains, no total opacity)

⚙️ Harpo is the result of **applied research**, **engineering**, and — why not? — **stubbornness**.  
And most importantly: **it works**.
